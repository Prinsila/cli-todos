Running the Application

To run the FooCoding CLI application, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up the Todos API Server

Before running the CLI tool, make sure you have the Todos API server set up and running. If you haven't set it up yet, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Todos API repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todos-api.git


   Navigate to the project directory: cd todos-api
   Install dependencies: npm install

   
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the directory of the FooCoding CLI application and install dependencies:
      cd foocoding-cli
      npm install
3. Run the CLI Tool
Once the server is running and dependencies are installed, you can run the CLI tool using Node.js. Here are some example commands:

To list all Todos: node index.js list
To add a new Todo: node index.js add "New Todo"
To update a Todo: node index.js update <id> "Updated Todo"
To delete a Todo: node index.js delete <id>

4. Exit the CLI Application
To exit the CLI application, type end or press Ctrl+C.

Note:
Make sure the Todos API server is running before using the CLI tool.
